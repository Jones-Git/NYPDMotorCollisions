            <h3><strong>The New York Police Department has open sourced their data on vehicle collisions that happen
                    throughout
                    the state.</strong></h3>

            <p>The reason I am intrested in this data is because of how useful it is to New York. It is important to
                study the trend of collisions that happen in NY so that the general public can be
                made more aware in order to stay safe, and also so that it may become possible that a means of
                prevention can be
                created to make our streets safer for the public.</p>
