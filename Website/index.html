            <h3><strong>The New York Police Department has open sourced their data on vehicle collisions that happen
                    throughout

            <p>The reason I am intrested in this data is because of how useful it is to New York. It is important to
                study the trend of collisions that happen in NY so that the general public can be
                made more aware in order to stay safe, and also so that it may become possible that a means of
                prevention can be
                created to make our streets safer for the public.

        </p>

        <p>We use the describe function in order to check whether we have missing data. These values usually show up as
            NaN for not availiable. We see that there is some NaN values that show up for some data. This could be
            because it was not recorded either accidentaly or on purpose. Or the case that </p>

            <em>PERSONS</em> refers to those that were directly involved in the collisions, the drivers and/or
            passengers. <br><br>
            <em>PEDESTRIANS</em> refers to those that were involved in the collisions, someone who is outside of the
            vehicle during time of collision.

        <div id="outlier">
            <h2>Outliers</h2>
            <p>An outlier is defined as an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random
                sample from a population. The keyword here is abnormal. If we take a look over at the <em>"Separated by
                    Zip Code</em> graph, we see that there are plotted values that look like they're outliers. </p>

            <p>However, those points are actually supposed to be included because they represent necessary data for our
                models. Each point is repsenting a mark where there have been most reported cases within certain zip
                codes.</p>

            <p>This data does not contain outliers, however it is important to note that zip codes contain many streets
                within them that intertwine between boroughs, so it would be difficult to make the theory that the
                amount of injury or deaths correspond to </p>

        <div id="missing_data">
            <h1>Missing Data</h1>
            <p>There is missing data in this data set. IF we look at the data head, we see a bunch of NaNs values.</p>
            <p>
                It's important to note that we should not remove these attributes from this dataframe because it is an
                essential part that describes the data. There are definitely instances where data could and should have
                been recorded, but the majority of the NaN values are from an abscence of <em>Contributing Factors</em>.
                There are cases where vehicles collided but not more than just two at a time, so these fields are left
                blank for these rows.
