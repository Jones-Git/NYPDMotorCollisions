        <div>
            <p>The reason I am intrested in this data is because of how useful it is to New York. It is important to
                study the trend of collisions that happen in NY so that the general public can be
                made more aware in order to stay safe, and also so that it may become possible that a means of
                prevention can be created to make our streets safer for the public.

        </p>

        <p>We use the describe function in order to check whether we have missing data. These values usually show up as
            NaN for not availiable. We see that there is some NaN values that show up for some data. This could be
            because it was not recorded either accidentaly or on purpose. Or the case that </p>

            and pedestrians combined. <br><br>

        <div id="outlier">
            <h1>Outliers</h1>
            <p>An outlier is defined as an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random
                sample from a population. The keyword here is abnormal. If we take a look over at the
                <em>"Separated by
                        Zip Code</em> graph, we see that there are plotted values that look like they're
                outliers. </p>

            <p>However, those points are actually supposed to be included because they represent necessary data for our
                models. Each point is repsenting a mark where there have been most reported cases within certain zip
                codes.</p>

            <p>This data does not contain outliers, however it is important to note that zip codes contain many streets
                within them that intertwine between boroughs, so it would be difficult to make the theory that the
                amount of injury or deaths correspond to </p>
        </div>

        <div id="missing_data">
            <h1>Missing Data</h1>
            <p>There is missing data in this data set. IF we look at the data head, we see a bunch of NaNs values.</p>
            <p>
                It's important to note that we should not remove these attributes from this dataframe because it is an
                essential part that describes the data. There are definitely instances where data could and should have
                been recorded - such as in the BOROUGH column - but the majority of the NaN values are from an abscence
                of <em>Contributing Factors</em>.
                There are cases where vehicles collided but not more than just two at a time, so these fields are left
                blank for these rows.

        <div id="logit">
            <h1>Linear Regression</h1>
            <p>I now want to determine whether I can make a linear regression model with my dataset. Doing so, I find
                that perhaps I am not using the proper variables to construct this, as my R-squared is far below the
                margins I require for it to show a relationship if any. Essentially what I am trying to accomplish here
                is an attempt to convey how the amount of people injured compares in each borough.</p>

            <p>I also attempted to see where Logistic regression could take me.</p>

        <div id="trees">
            <h1>Decision Trees</h1>
            <p>It appears my decision tree is leaning hard to the right. I assume this is because it is only finding the first index of my X test to condstruct the tree. </p>
        </div>

        <div id="k-neighbor">
            <h1>K-Neighbors</h1>
            <p>My k-neighbors section is trying to compare connections between the 5 nearest points on my dataset.
                However I was having trouble trying to parse through to get the values. This is likely because of the
                large amount of Nan values my dataset has.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>As an extra, something I was most excited for, I created a folium map of the data, being that it had
                location values availiable, so it made the most sense to use.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Final thoughts</h1>
            <p>This project is far from done, in the future I aim to build up on it and better the obvious eras it has. Let
                it be noted that the dataset itself has a share of its problems, so perhaps a new one will be required to
                conduct more proper research.</p>
